                    <div id="tribute-info" class="thumbnail"><p>Elon Musk's parents are Errol Musk and Maye Musk; his parents met in high school. Errol Musk was a South African engineer4 Maye Musk, a native of Canada, moved to Pretoria, South Africa in 1950, is a nutritionist and model.56 They married in 1970 and in three years they had three children: Elon Musk (28 June 1971), Kimbal Musk (September 20, 1972) and Tosca Musk (July 20, 1974).   <br> <br> Elon Musk grew up in a large house with his brother Kimbal, his sister Tosca, and several cousins. Maye worked at home as a nutrition consultant for clients. On the weekends Maye worked as a model, so her children hardly saw her parents and had a lot of freedom to pursue her interests. At the age of nine, he began programming a Commodore VIC-20 that had 8 kilobytes of RAM.7 At the age of ten, he learned to program.8 At the age of twelve, he designed his first program, a space game called Blastar, and became he sold it for the equivalent of $500 to the South African magazine PC and Office Technology. In 1984 they published the 167 lines of source code and reviewed "In this game you have to destroy an alien freighter carrying deadly hydrogen bombs and Status Beam Machines. The program makes good use of sprites and animations, and in this regard it is well worth reading." 
                        <br><br>
                        The money he earned from programming was spent on comics, computers, and role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
                        
                        In 1979, to escape abuse from her husband, Maye divorced her and moved to Durban. Errol challenged the terms of the divorce in court.12 In 1981 Elon decided to move to Johannesburg with her father. Kimbal joined them four years later.
                    
                     At school he had no friends and was mistreated by his classmates. After taking classes in karate, judo, wrestling and at the age of sixteen growing up to 180 cm, he began to defend himself. After graduating from Pretoria High School for Boys he left home when he was seventeen, without the support of his parents. parents and partly due to compulsory military service in the South African Army. Since his mother was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, to American parents, and since many of his relatives lived in Western Canada, Musk emigrated to Canada. In 1989 Elon, Kimbal, Tosca and Maye Musk moved to Kingston, Ontario.
                
                        When she arrived in Canada, all of Maye's savings were blocked, so she had to work multiple jobs [citation needed]. Maye rented a small apartment in Toronto where she spent three weeks removing staples from the floor and wallpaper from the walls. In the process Maye cut her hand and put her jobs as a hand model at risk. With the first money she earned, Maye bought a thick rug for them to sleep on the floor of the apartment and a computer for Elon Musk.
                    
                        Maye worked as a researcher at the University of Toronto. She simultaneously taught nutrition and modeling classes two nights a week and was also working as a nutrition consultant and studying for her second dietary master's degree. Her three children had to get scholarships, take out loans and work to study at university. Many months they could not eat red meat even once a week. 
                        <br><br>
                        In 1992 Elon was awarded a scholarship to study Economics and Physics at the University of Pennsylvania. She received her Economics and Physics degrees from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He then enrolled at Stanford to do his doctorate but after two days he left to start his own company. In 1995 he intended to work for Netscape and went to their offices, but he did not dare to talk to anyone out of shyness.
                        
                        One of his professors at the University of Pennsylvania was CEO of a company in Los Gatos, Silicon Valley, dedicated to researching electrolytic ultracapacitors for electric vehicles. Elon Musk spent a summer at Pinnacle Research. Those ultracapacitors had a very high energy density, but their chemical components were very expensive and were sold by the milligram because there were very few mines to extract them. They were not scalable for mass production.</p>
